# Code Refactor

## Purpose
In this project I added semantic HTML to this page to make it comply with accesability standards.
This was done not only through semantic elements such as header and footer instead of div
but also by adding alt attributes to images as well as and giving the site a proper title.

## Built With
* HTML
* CSS
